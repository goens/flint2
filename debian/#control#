Description: Fast Library for Number Theory
 FLINT provides types and functions for computing over various base rings. 
 FLINT uses many new algorithms and is sometimes orders of magnitude faster
 than other available software.
 .
 FLINT is written in ANSI C and runs on many platforms,
 but is currently mostly optimised for x86 and x86-64 architectures.
 It is designed to be threadsafe.
